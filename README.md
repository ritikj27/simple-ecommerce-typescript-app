In TypeScript, when dealing with HTML elements and events, it's important to have a clear understanding of the types associated with them. Here are some commonly used events and corresponding HTML tags in TypeScript:

1. **ChangeEvent**: This event is commonly used with form elements like `<input>`, `<textarea>`, and `<select>` when their values change. The `ChangeEvent` interface represents the event object that is emitted when the value of an input element changes.

   ```typescript
   import { ChangeEvent } from 'react';

   const handleChange = (event: ChangeEvent<HTMLInputElement>) => {
     console.log(event.target.value);
   };
   ```

   HTML Tags: `<input>`, `<textarea>`, `<select>`

2. **MouseEvent**: This event is triggered when a mouse action occurs, such as a click, hover, or drag.

   ```typescript
   import { MouseEvent } from 'react';

   const handleClick = (event: MouseEvent<HTMLButtonElement>) => {
     console.log('Button clicked');
   };
   ```

   HTML Tags: `<button>`, `<a>`, `<div>`, etc.

3. **KeyboardEvent**: This event is triggered when a keyboard key is pressed.

   ```typescript
   import { KeyboardEvent } from 'react';

   const handleKeyPress = (event: KeyboardEvent<HTMLInputElement>) => {
     if (event.key === 'Enter') {
       console.log('Enter key pressed');
     }
   };
   ```

   HTML Tags: `<input>`, `<textarea>`, etc.

4. **FormEvent**: This event is triggered when a form is submitted.

   ```typescript
   import { FormEvent } from 'react';

   const handleSubmit = (event: FormEvent<HTMLFormElement>) => {
     event.preventDefault();
     console.log('Form submitted');
   };
   ```

   HTML Tag: `<form>`

5. **FocusEvent**: This event is triggered when an element gains or loses focus.

   ```typescript
   import { FocusEvent } from 'react';

   const handleFocus = (event: FocusEvent<HTMLInputElement>) => {
     console.log('Input focused');
   };
   ```

   HTML Tags: `<input>`, `<textarea>`, etc.

These are some important events and HTML tags commonly used in TypeScript when working with user interactions in web development. Make sure to import the appropriate event types from the `react` package when working with React components.
